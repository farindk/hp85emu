HP-85 Emulator Frequently Asked Questions
=========================================

SECTION I: GENERAL
------------------
1) Q:	Is there an opcode I can put into a binary program that I'm writing
        that, when executed, will cause the emulator to break into DEBUG
        mode?
   A:	Yes, put:
            BYT 336
        in your BPGM source code file where you'd like the emulator to
        automatically break.  336 is normally a NOP instruction in the
        Capricorn CPU, but the 3.5.1 and greater emulator has been
        modified to automatically break into debug mode when it tries
        to execute that instruction.
