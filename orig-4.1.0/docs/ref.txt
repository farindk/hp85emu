The HP-85 PROGRAM CONTROL BLOCK has this format:
 BYTE#  DESCRIPTION              			OFFSET NAME
 -----  ----------------------------------	-----------
   0	NAME[0]
   1	NAME[1]
   2	NAME[2]
   3	NAME[3]
   4	NAME[4]
   5	NAME[5]
   6	program TYPE (see below)			P.TYPE
   7	program LENGTH (2 bytes)			P.LEN
  10
  11	COM length or SUB RTN (2 bytes)		P.COM or P.SUBR
  12
  13	DATA line ptr (2 bytes)				P.DATL
  14
  15	DATA item ptr (2 bytes)				P.DATA
  16
  17	Reserved Mem Pointer (2 bytes)		P.RMEM
  20
  21	Active FOR/NEXT counter				P.FCNT
  22	Active GOSUB counter				P.GCNT
  23	not used
  24	not used
  25	Security bits						P.SFLG
  26	Security code (2 bytes)				P.SCOD
  27

  30	4 BCD digits LINE NUMBER (2 bytes)	P.GO
  31
  32	LENGTH of first BASIC line
  33 	first token of first BASIC line		P.FIRS
  
The PROGRAM TYPE (byte 6 of the header above) is:
  BIT	DESCRIPTION
  ---	------------------------------------
   0	Program type (0=MAIN, 1=SUBPROGRAM)
   1	Program type (0=BASIC, 1=BINARY PROGRAM)
   2	not used
   3	not used
   4	not used
   5	Allocation (0=NOT allocated, 1=ALLOCATED)
   6	Option base (0=OptionBase 1, 1=OptionBase 0)
   7	COMMON flag (0=NO common, 1=COMMON block)

The above info for the HP-87 is DIFFERENT and upside-down.
Hopefully someday I'll have time to document it here.

TAPE LAYOUT
-------------------------------------------------------
The HP-85 tape cartridges contained at most 43 files.
File 0 was always the TAPE DIRECTORY, and was always
4 records long.  Files 1-42 were the user-created files.
The tape itself had 2 TRACKS, 0 and 1.

There were TWO COPIES of the TAPE DIRECTORY, one in
records 0 and 1 of file 0, and a second in records 2 and 3
of file 0.  Record 2 was an exact duplicate of record 0,
and record 3 was an exact duplicate of record 1.  Only
one record of the directory could be read into memory at
a time, so the system had to keep track of whether the
first 1/2 or the second 1/2 of the directory was in memory
(or neither).

Each DIRECTORY RECORD consisted of 21 12-byte directory
entries, which equals 252 bytes.  The final 4 bytes of
each record as follows:
  252	directory segment flag (0 or 1).
  253	FILE# of file that wraps from the end of TRACK 0 to
  		the beginning of TRACK 1.
  254	(2 bytes) RECORD# of first record of the split file
  255		that's on TRACK 1.

Each DIRECTORY ENTRY consists of 12 bytes, allocated thusly:
  BYTES	DESCRIPTION
  -----	---------------------------------------------
  0-5	ASCII FILE NAME, blank filled
  6		EXTENDED File Type
  7		FILE TYPE
  8-9	# RECORDS in the file
  10-11	# BYTES in each record
  
The FILE TYPE is thus:
  BIT	DESCRIPTION
  ---	-----------------------------------------------
   0	No directory name listed
   1	Soft write protect
   2	Extended file type (****)
   3	Binary Program (BPGM)
   4	Data file (DATA)
   5	BASIC Program (PRGM)
   6	Empty file (NULL)
   7	Next available file
   
The most significant bit of the EXTENDED FILE TYPE byte will
signify extended file type as well as BIT 2 of FILE TYPE, but
it shouldn't be used, as a bug in the system doesn't clear that
bit if you purge the file.  The lower seven bits allow the
differentiation between various extended file types (****).

DISK LAYOUT
-------------------------------------------------------
The HP-85/87 disks used the LIF (Logical Interchange Format) disk
layout.  The first sector on the disk (cylinder 0, head 0, sector 0)
contained the VOLUME sector.  The important things in the VOLUME
sector were thus:

  BYTE	DESCRIPTION
  ----	-----------------------------------------------
    0	Disc ID, always 0x80
    1	Disc ID, always 0x00
  2-7	6-character volume LABEL
  8-9	always 0
   10	upper byte of sector# of START of DIRECTORY
   11   lower byte of sector# of START of DIRECTORY
   12   always 0x10 (HP 3000 constant)
   13	always 0
  14-17 always 0
   18	upper byte of # of sectors in DIRECTORY
   19   lower byte of # of sectors in DIRECTORY
  255	used by the HP-85 emulator to hold "write-protect" status
  
Each directory sector held 8 32-byte directory entries.  Each entry
contained these values:

  BYTE	DESCRIPTION
  ----	------------------------------------------------
  0-9	10-character file name (blank filled)
  10	upper byte of file TYPE (see below)
  11	lower byte of file TYPE
  12-15	START of FILE (most signicant byte first)
  16-19	LENGTH of FILE in sectors (most significant byte first)
  20-25	file CREATION DATE
  26	always 0x80
  27	always 0x01 entire file is on this volume
  28	lower byte of # of BYTES in this FILE
  29	upper byte of # of BYTES in this FILE
  30	lower byte of BYTES per LOGICAL RECORD
  31	upper byte of BYTES per LOGICAL RECORD
  
Note that MOST values in LIF discs' VOLUME and DIRECTORY
sectors are stored in "big-endian" format (most significant
byte first, least significant byte last).  The Series 80
CPU was "little-endian", it stored the least significant
byte first (at the lower address) and the most significant
byte last (at the upper address).  That's why the last two
entries in the directory entries (bytes/file and bytes/record)
were stored in byte-reversed order from the other "official"
LIF values.

The file TYPE value was:

 byte 1	byte 2	Meaning
 ------	------	------------------------------------------
  0x00	 0x00	(WORD value of 0) PURGE'd file
  0xFF	 0xFF	(WORD value of 0xFFFF=-1) NEXT available file
  0x00	 0x01	(WORD value of 1) LIF ASCII file
  0xE0	 0x04	Capricorn **** extended file type (ASSM, GRAF)
  0xE0	 0x08	Capricorn BPGM file
  0xE0	 0x10	Capricorn DATA file
  0xE0	 0x20	Capricorn PROG file
