// NOTE: the TAPEK below, which specifies the Kbytes length of a tape cartridge,
// is not designed to be changed.  It was here to make my trial and error design
// of the tape simulation easier.  Changing it NOW will cause havoc with any "tapes"
// created earlier at the "original" tape size of 196 Kbytes / track.  In other words,
// DON'T try to make longer (or shorter) tapes by changing it.  Leave it as-is.
#define	TAPEK		196
// The TAPREV is stored into the first word of TAPBUF before a "tape" is written to
// its disk file.  This is included in case any changes or additions to the tape
// format needs to be made in the future.  Currently, the first few WORDs of the
// TAPBUF image are used for:
//	0	tape format revision (TAPREV)
//	1	write protect, 0000 or 0010, the lower byte of which gets OR'd into TAPSTS
//	2-3	a DWORD which gets stored into TAPPOS when the tape is "inserted" (loaded)
//		which controls the initial "tape position", just as a real physical tape
//		would be left positioned where it was when it was ejected.  This isn't really
//		necessary, it could always be positioned at the rewind position every time
//		it's loaded, but this adds to the "reality" of the simulation.
