Work in progress! Not much to see yet.

This is a port of the excellent HP Series-80 emulator by Everett Kaser ([link](http://www.kaser.com/hp85.html)) to Linux/Qt.

Original source code (version 4.1.0) is in the orig-4.1.0 directory. Please check the docs/readme.txt file in that directory for the legal stuff.
